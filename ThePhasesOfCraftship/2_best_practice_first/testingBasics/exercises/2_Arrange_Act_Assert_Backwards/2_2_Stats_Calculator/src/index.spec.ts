//Description: Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers to determine the following statistics:
// Without using system Math library functions, process a sequence of integers
// to determine the following statistics:
//minimum value = -8,
//  maximum value = 53,
// number of elements in the sequence = 6,
// average value = 18.666666666667

//doings -
// compute minimum value
// compute max value
// compute number of elements
// compute average value
